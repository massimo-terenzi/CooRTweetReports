# CooRTweetReports

**CooRTweetReports** is a browser-based tool to analyze coordinated social media activity using OpenAI's GPT models.  
It works in combination with two R packages:

- [`CooRTweet`](https://github.com/nicolarighetti/CooRTweet) — for detecting coordinated behavior across platforms.  
- [`CooRTweetPost`](https://github.com/massimo-terenzi/CooRTweetPost) — for post-processing network outputs into summary tables.

👉 **Try it directly in your browser (no installation needed):**

## ✨ What's New

- **Content ID Tracking**: Optionally include content identifiers in the examples analyzed by GPT
  - Enable via checkbox: "Include content IDs in examples"
  - When enabled, GPT receives both the text and its content reference for verification
  - Useful for tracing coordinated content back to original posts (URLs, post IDs, or other identifiers)

---

## 🔍 What it does

This tool takes in:

- `coordinated_communities.csv`  
- `coordinated_objects_by_community.csv`

…and allows you to:

1. Filter the most relevant communities by number of unique objects and vertices.  
2. Sample and preview the shared texts (`object_id`) per community.  
3. **Optionally include content identifiers** (`content_id`) for each text example.
4. Generate a structured narrative analysis using OpenAI's GPT (via your API key).  
5. Export a complete **Word (.doc)** report with an optional **Executive Summary**.  
6. View results interactively in the browser, with progress indicators and stop controls.

## 🧪 Example workflow

1. Run your coordination detection pipeline with `CooRTweet`.  
2. Post-process the results with [`CooRTweetPost`](https://github.com/massimo-terenzi/CooRTweetPost) (v0.3.0+) in R:
```r
   library(CooRTweetPost)
   
   # Detect coordinated groups
   coordinated_groups <- detect_groups(
     x = my_data,
     min_participation = 2,
     time_window = 60
   )
   
   # Generate network
   g <- generate_coordinated_network(
     coordinated_groups,
     edge_weight = 0.8,
     subgraph = 1,
     objects = TRUE
   )
   
   # Export all results
   export_all_results(coordinated_groups, g, output_dir = "output")
```

3. Upload the generated CSV files to [CooRTweetReports](https://massimo-terenzi.github.io/CooRTweetReports/)
4. Configure your analysis parameters:
   - Select % of top communities
   - Set max sample size per community
   - **Enable/disable content IDs** (new!)
   - Add your OpenAI API key
5. Generate and export your narrative report

## 🛠️ Features

- **No installation required** — runs entirely in your browser
- **Privacy-focused** — all processing happens client-side (except GPT API calls)
- **Interactive filtering** — preview and select communities before analysis
- **Structured reports** — GPT-generated narratives organized by community
- **Content ID tracking** — optionally include content references for verification ✨ NEW
- **Export to Word** — download professional .doc reports with optional executive summary
- **Progress tracking** — real-time progress indicators with stop controls

---

## 📊 Input Requirements

The tool works with CSV files generated by [CooRTweetPost v0.3.0+](https://github.com/massimo-terenzi/CooRTweetPost):

### coordinated_communities.csv
Required columns:
- `community` — Community ID
- `unique_vertices` — Number of accounts in the community
- `unique_objects` — Number of shared objects

Optional (for enhanced analysis):
- `content_ids` — Comma-separated list of content identifiers

### coordinated_objects_by_community.csv
Required columns:
- `community` — Community ID
- `object_id` — The shared text/object

Optional (for content ID tracking):
- `content_id` — Content identifier (e.g., post URL, post ID, or other reference) ✨ NEW in v0.3.0+

---

## 💡 Content ID Feature

When you enable "Include content IDs in examples":

**Without content IDs:**
```
- This is a coordinated post about topic X
- Another post sharing similar narrative
```

**With content IDs:**
```
- This is a coordinated post about topic X
  [Source: https://example.com/post/123]
- Another post sharing similar narrative
  [Source: post_id_456]
```

GPT can then:
- Reference specific sources in its analysis
- Enable direct verification of coordinated content
- Provide more accurate attribution in the report

**Content IDs can be:**
- URLs (Facebook MCL links, Twitter/X URLs, etc.)
- Platform-specific post IDs
- Custom identifiers from your dataset
- Any reference that helps trace back to the original content

---

## 🔑 OpenAI API Key

Your API key is:
- Stored only in your browser session
- Never sent to any server except OpenAI
- Not logged or saved anywhere

The tool uses `gpt-4o-mini` by default for cost efficiency. Typical cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per community analysis.

---

## 📄 Export Format

The Word export includes:
- **Executive Summary** (optional) — High-level overview of all communities
- **Community-by-community analysis** — Detailed GPT-generated narratives
- **Source attribution** — Content IDs when enabled
- **Professional formatting** — Ready for reports and presentations
